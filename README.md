# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to assist the client with a project campaign for her local theater. Specific objectives included the organization and analysis of data on metrics such as; overall outcomes, geographic location and return on investment. Final step was to create visualizations based on data trends. 
## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis was conducted utilizing Kickstarter data. Factors in analysis were successful and failing launches of theater productions were; timing of launch, and geographic location, fundraising goals.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 Movies are more successful when they are launched in May, this could be because the school year ends and more school aged children have time to go to the theater
	The theaters had the closest overlap in December, this suggests a low turnout overall. This could perhaps be due to high travel volume during the holidays.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The most successful campaigns were the ones that had a lower fundraising goal. This could have to do with the belief from investors in the success of a project or the lower risk for a financially responsible theater production.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Slight difficulties were encountered when using the COUNTIF function while analyzing data from multiple spreadsheets. These was overcome by reevaluating information from similar data sets and following online tutorials.
## Results
-  Some potential limitations on this data set are the lack of alternate variables, such as the comparison between theater and films budgeting vs outcomes. It would be important to consider this as there are other external factors influencing theaters beyond budget and geographic location.

-  One possible alternate visualization tool would be to utilize a pie graph to look at different theater productions and their overall success/fail rate. This would be helpful to look at factors such as funding vs outcome to determine how closely related funding is to overall success.
